# Welcome to Ghost
**Your own blogging platform!**

The moment you start Ghost, it is ready to run and waiting for you to finish some basic site setup in **Ghost Admin** at:
> `http://your_ghost_address_from_preferences.onion/ghost`

You can copy your unique address from the **Services > Ghost > Properties** section.

After simple site setup and account creation you will receive an confirmation e-mail that brand new Ghost publication has been successfully created.

>📝 Check your e-mail's SPAM folder and set your Ghost mail recipient as trusted (not spam).

Further admin registrations are closed. You can now start blogging!

>⚠️ Ghost is expected to work **only on one domain** address. In this case, it is operating on `.onion` address and that will give you fully fledged Ghost experience. That said for your convenience `.local` address has been enabled as well to deal with uploading larger files and making maintenance changes locally (for example, if Tor is overloaded), but be advised that some preview features might not work as expected when working on .local address.

**TIP:** To enable comments go to **Settings > Membership** page in Ghost Admin and set **Commenting** to **All members**. 

We recommend visiting [Ghost resources page](https://ghost.org/resources) to learn more about using Ghost.

Happy blogging!
