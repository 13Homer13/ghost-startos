# Welcome to Ghost
**Your own blogging platform!**

The moment you start Ghost, it is ready to run and waiting for you to finish some basic site setup in **Ghost Admin** at:
> `http://<your-ghost-address-from-interfaces>/ghost`

Alternatively, you can copy your unique address from the **Services > Ghost > Properties** section.

After simple site setup and account creation, make sure to store your password somewhere safe (like your self-hosted Vaultwarden).

Further admin registrations are closed. You can now start blogging!

>üìß Direct transactional and bulk e-mail delivery is not supported. If you need full e-mail support in Ghost, you have to use [Mailgun](https://ghost.org/docs/faq/mailgun-newsletters/).

>‚ö†Ô∏è Ghost is expected to work **only on one domain** address. In this case, it is operating on a `.onion` address and that will give you a fully-fledged Ghost experience. For your convenience, a `.local` (LAN) address has been enabled for uploading larger files and making maintenance changes locally (for example, if Tor is overloaded), but be advised that some preview features might not work as expected when working on the LAN address.

We recommend visiting the [Ghost resources page](https://ghost.org/resources) to learn more about using Ghost.

Happy blogging!
