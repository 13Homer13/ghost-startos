# Welcome to Ghost
**Your own blogging platform!**

The moment you start Ghost, it is ready to run and waiting for you to finish some basic site setup and admin account creation at:
> `http://your_ghost_address_from_preferences.onion/ghost`

You can copy your unique address from the **Ghost > Properties** section.

After the simple site setup and account creation in Ghost, further registrations are closed.

You can now start blogging!

>⚠️ Ghost is expected to work **only on one domain** address. In this case, it is operating on `.onion` address and that will give you fully fledged Ghost experience. That said for your convenience `.local` address has been enabled as well to deal with uploading larger files and making maintenance changes locally (for example, if Tor is overloaded), but be advised that some preview features might not work as expected when working on .local address.

We recommend visiting [Ghost resources page](https://ghost.org/resources) to learn more about using Ghost.
