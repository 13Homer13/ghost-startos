# Welcome to Ghost
**Your own blogging platform!**

The moment you start Ghost, it is ready to run and waiting for you to finish some basic site setup and admin account creation at:
`http://your_ghost_address_from_preferences.onion/ghost`
You can copy your unique address from the **Ghost > Properties** section.

After the simple site setup and account creation in Ghost further registrations are closed.

You can now start blogging!

We recommend visiting [Ghost resources page](https://ghost.org/resources) to learn more about using Ghost.
